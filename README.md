## Introduction
The Self-Balancing Inverted Pendulum Simulation is an educational project that demonstrates the principles of control systems and dynamic stability. The simulation is developed using MATLAB and Simscape to model and analyze the behavior of an inverted pendulum system.

## Features
- Real-time balance control simulation using a gyroscope and accelerometer model
- PID control for stable and responsive performance
- Visualization of the pendulum's motion and control response
- Adjustable control parameters for experimentation
- Open-source code and simulation models

## Model Picture
Here is a picture of the complete model:

## Software Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020a or later)
- Simscape (Add-on for MATLAB)
- Control System Toolbox (Add-on for MATLAB)
- Optional: Simulink (for advanced simulation features)
