Introduction
The Self-Balancing Inverted Pendulum Simulation is an educational project that demonstrates the principles of control systems and dynamic stability. The simulation is developed using MATLAB and Simscape to model and analyze the behavior of an inverted pendulum system.

Features
Real-time balance control simulation using a gyroscope and accelerometer model

PID control for stable and responsive performance

Visualization of the pendulum's motion and control response

Adjustable control parameters for experimentation

Open-source code and simulation models

Software Requirements
MATLAB (R2020a or later)

Simscape (Add-on for MATLAB)

Control System Toolbox (Add-on for MATLAB)

Optional: Simulink (for advanced simulation features)

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-balancing-inverted-pendulum-simulation.git
Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

Open the main simulation file (e.g., inverted_pendulum_sim.slx or inverted_pendulum_sim.m).

Usage
Run the Simulation: Open the main simulation file in MATLAB and run it using the Simulink interface or MATLAB commands.

Adjust Control Parameters: Modify the PID control parameters in the simulation to observe different behaviors and optimize performance.

Analyze Results: Use MATLAB's plotting and analysis tools to visualize the pendulum's motion and control response.
